The `style` tag contains a CSS rule that sets the `border` property of the canvas element with an id of \"canvas\" to \"1px solid black\".

You can do this by setting the `background` CSS property of the canvas element to a linear gradient.\n\n3. Add a shadow to the snake and food to make them appear more three-dimensional.

If the snake's position is out of bounds, we wrap its position around to the opposite side of the canvas. For example, if the snake goes out of bounds on the left side of the canvas, we set its x position to the right side of the canvas minus the block size. This will make the snake appear on the opposite side of the canvas and continue moving in the same direction.\n\n",

      "message": "how do I add touch controls?",
      "response": "To add touch controls to the game, you can use the `touchstart` and `touchmove` events to detect when the user touches the screen and moves their finger. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize touch variables\nlet touchStartX = 0;\nlet touchStartY = 0;\nlet touchEndX = 0;\nlet touchEndY = 0;\n\n// Add touch event listeners to the canvas element\ncanvas.addEventListener('touchstart', handleTouchStart);\ncanvas.addEventListener('touchmove', handleTouchMove);\n\n// Handle touch start event\nfunction handleTouchStart(event) {\n  touchStartX = event.touches[0].clientX;\n  touchStartY = event.touches[0].clientY;\n}\n\n// Handle touch move event\nfunction handleTouchMove(event) {\n  touchEndX = event.touches[0].clientX;\n  touchEndY = event.touches[0].clientY;\n\n  // Calculate touch direction based on start and end positions\n  const touchDirectionX = touchEndX - touchStartX;\n  const touchDirectionY = touchEndY - touchStartY;\n\n  // Set snake direction based on touch direction\n  if (Math.abs(touchDirectionX) > Math.abs(touchDirectionY)) {\n    if (touchDirectionX > 0) {\n      direction = 'right';\n    } else {\n      direction = 'left';\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (touchDirectionY > 0) {\n      direction = 'down';\n    } else {\n      direction = 'up';\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've added event listeners to the canvas element for the `touchstart` and `touchmove` events. We've also added two functions to handle these events. The `handleTouchStart` function sets the `touchStartX` and `touchStartY` variables to the clientX and clientY properties of the first touch in the event. The `handleTouchMove` function sets the `touchEndX` and `touchEndY` variables to the clientX and clientY properties of the first touch in the event. It then calculates the touch direction based on the difference between the start and end positions, and sets the snake direction based on the touch direction.\n\nYou can customize this code to suit your needs, such as changing the touch sensitivity or adding support for multiple touches.\n\n",

If the snake's position is out of bounds, we wrap its position around to the opposite side of the canvas. For example, if the snake goes out of bounds on the left side of the canvas, we set its x position to the right side of the canvas minus the block size. This will make the snake appear on the opposite side of the canvas and continue moving in the same direction.\n\n[COMMANDS START]\n- `if`\n- `else if`\n- `canvasWidth`\n- `canvasHeight`\n- `blockSize`\n[COMMANDS END]",

The `handleTouchMove` function sets the `touchEndX` and `touchEndY` variables to the clientX and clientY properties of the first touch in the event. It then calculates the touch direction based on the difference between the start and end positions, and sets the snake direction based on the touch direction.\n\nYou can customize this code to suit your needs, such as changing the touch sensitivity or adding support for multiple touches.\n\n[COMMANDS START]\n- `addEventListener`\n- `touchstart`\n- `touchmove`\n- `clientX`\n- `clientY`\n- `Math.abs`\n[COMMANDS END]",

Make sure you are drawing the obstacles on the canvas. You can do this by adding a loop to the `draw` function that draws each obstacle on the canvas. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Draw the obstacles on the canvas\nfunction drawObstacles() {\n  for (let i = 0; i < obstacles.length; i++) {\n    context.fillStyle = 'red';\n    context.fillRect(obstacles[i].x, obstacles[i].y, blockSize, blockSize);\n  }\n}\n\n// Add the drawObstacles function to the draw function\nfunction draw() {\n  context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);\n  drawSnake();\n  drawFood();\n  drawObstacles();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've added a `drawObstacles` function that loops through the `obstacles` array and draws each obstacle on the canvas using the `fillRect` method. We've also added a call to the `drawObstacles` function in the `draw` function to draw the obstacles on the canvas.\n\n2. Make sure the obstacles are not being drawn outside the canvas. If an obstacle is being drawn outside the canvas, it will not be visible. You can check this by making sure the `x` and `y` properties of each obstacle are within the bounds of the canvas.\n\n3. Make sure the obstacles are not being drawn behind other elements on the canvas. If an obstacle is being drawn behind the snake or food, it may not be visible. You can check this by making sure the `drawObstacles` function is called after the `drawSnake` and `drawFood` functions in the `draw` function.\n\n[COMMANDS START]\n- `fillRect`\n- `clearRect`\n- `for`\n[COMMANDS END]",

Make sure the obstacles are being drawn on the canvas. You can check this by adding a loop to the `draw` function that draws each obstacle on the canvas. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Draw the obstacles on the canvas\nfunction drawObstacles() {\n  for (let i = 0; i < obstacles.length; i++) {\n    context.fillStyle = 'red';\n    context.fillRect(obstacles[i].x, obstacles[i].y, blockSize, blockSize);\n  }\n}\n\n// Add the drawObstacles function to the draw function\nfunction draw() {\n  context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);\n  drawSnake();\n  drawFood();\n  drawObstacles();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've added a `drawObstacles` function that loops through the `obstacles` array and draws each obstacle on the canvas using the `fillRect` method. We've also added a call to the `drawObstacles` function in the `draw` function to draw the obstacles on the canvas.\n\n3. Make sure the collision detection code is correct. You can check this by making sure the `checkCollisions` function is being called in the game loop and that it is checking for collisions between the snake and the obstacles. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Check for collisions with the walls, the snake's own body, and the obstacles\nfunction checkCollisions() {\n  // Wrap the snake's position around to the opposite side of the canvas if it goes out of bounds\n  if (snake[0].x < 0) {\n    snake[0].x = canvasWidth - blockSize;\n  } else if (snake[0].x >= canvasWidth) {\n    snake[0].x = 0;\n  } else if (snake[0].y < 0) {\n    snake[0].y = canvasHeight - blockSize;\n  } else if (snake[0].y >= canvasHeight) {\n    snake[0].y = 0;\n  }\n\n  // Check for collision with the snake's own body\n  for (let i = 1; i < snake.length; i++) {\n    if (snake[0].x === snake[i].x && snake[0].y === snake[i].y) {\n      gameOver();\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Check for collision with obstacles\n  for (let i = 0; i < obstacles.length; i++) {\n    if (snake[0].x === obstacles[i].x && snake[0].y === obstacles[i].y) {\n      gameOver();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Call the checkCollisions function in the game loop\nfunction gameLoop() {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);\n    draw();\n    moveSnake();\n    checkCollisions();\n  }, 1000 / fps);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've added a loop to the `checkCollisions` function that checks for collisions between the snake and the obstacles. If the snake collides with an obstacle, the `gameOver` function is called to end the game. We've also added a call to the `checkCollisions` function in the `gameLoop` function to check for collisions in each frame of the game.\n\nYou can customize this code to suit your needs, such as changing the size and position of the obstacles or adjusting the collision detection code.\n\n[COMMANDS START]\n- `console.log`\n- `fillRect`\n- `clearRect`\n- `for`\n- `setTimeout`\n- `requestAnimationFrame`\n[COMMANDS END]",
